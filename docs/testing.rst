Testing
-------

Using the tools provided in `reactivex.testing`, it is possible to create tests for 
your own observables, custom operators and subscriptions.

Additionally, tests can be used to help understand the behaviors of existing operators.

Basic example
.............

.. code:: python

    # This assumes that you are using pytest but unittest or others would work just as well
    # Import the testing tools
    from reactivex.testing import ReactiveTest, TestScheduler
    from reactivex import operators

    def test_double():
        # Create a scheduler
        scheduler = TestScheduler()
        # Define one or more source
        source = scheduler.create_hot_observable(
            ReactiveTest.on_next(250, 3),
            ReactiveTest.on_next(350, 5),
        )

        # Define how the observable/operator is used on the source
        def create():
            return source.pipe(operators.map(lambda x: 2 * x))

        # trigger subscription and record emissions
        results = scheduler.start(create)

        # check the messages and potentially subscriptions
        assert results.messages == [
            ReactiveTest.on_next(250, 6),
            ReactiveTest.on_next(350, 10),
        ]


Testing a custom operator
.........................

Whether your custom operator is created using a *composition* of operators 
or with full control, you can easily test various situations and combinations

.. _in_sequence_or_throw:

.. code:: python
    # setting up aliases for more concise code
    on_next = ReactiveTest.on_next
    on_error = ReactiveTest.on_error
    on_completed = ReactiveTest.on_completed

    def test_operator():
        # Code to test; takes a sequence of integers and passes through,
        # unless they are not in sequence in which case it errors
        def in_sequence_or_throw():
            return reactivex.compose(
                operators.start_with(None),
                operators.pairwise(),
                operators.flat_map(lambda x: reactivex.of(x[1]) if (
                    x[0] is None or x[1] == x[0] + 1
                ) else reactivex.throw(ValueError('Sequence error')))
            )
        ## End of code to test

        scheduler = TestScheduler()
        # Create source
        source = scheduler.create_cold_observable(
            on_next(300, 1), on_next(400, 2), on_next(500, 3), on_completed(600)
        )
        # Here is another way to create the same observable
        source = reactivex.from_marbles('------1-2-3-|', timespan=50)
        # You can shorten the "create" function from the basic example to a lambda with no arguments
        result = scheduler.start(lambda: source.pipe(
            in_sequence_or_throw(),
        ))
        assert result.messages == [
            on_next(500, 1), on_next(600, 2), on_next(700, 3), on_completed(800)
        ]

Surprised about the timestamps (@500, @600, ...) for the result messages? 
Then read below about the timeline.

Timeline
........

When ``scheduler.start`` is called, the test scheduler starts moving its virtual clock forward.
Some important timestamps are however hidden as defaults, as listed below.
These values can be modified using `kwargs` in the ``scheduler.start(...)`` call:

1. ``created`` [100]: When is the observable created. 
   That is when the ``create`` function seen in the basic example is called.
2. ``subscribed`` [200]: When does the subscription occur. 
   This explains the above emission timestamps: 
   consider the first emission @500; given that we are using a cold observable,
   and subscribe to it at 200, the `source`'s timeline starts at 200 and only 300 ticks later, it emits.
3. ``disposed`` [1000]: When the subscription is disposed

Gotchas when modifying these values:

1. Do not use `0` as values for created/subscribed since the code would ignore it.
2. If you change ``subscribed`` to be lower than 100, you need to change ``created`` as well,
   otherwise nothing will happen.

An alternative using marbles
............................

As we saw in the previous section, we can use `reactivex.from_marbles` 
to create observables for our tests.

An example of using `to_marbles` for the assertion is shown in test_hot_

There is a simplified flow available in `reactivex.testing.marbles` and here's an example:

.. code:: python
    
    def test_start_with():
        from reactivex.testing.marbles import marbles_testing
        with marbles_testing() as (start, cold, hot, exp):
            source = cold('------1-2-3-|')
            outcome = exp('a-----1-2-3-|', {"a": None})  # can use lookups if needed
            obs = source.pipe(
                operators.start_with(None)
            )
            # Note that start accepts the observable directly, 
            # without the need for a "create" function
            results = start(obs)  
            
            assert results == outcome

This method makes for very quick to write, and easy to read, tests.
At this moment however, it does not allow for testing subscriptions.


Testing an observable factory
.............................

An observable created directly from :class:`Observable <reactivex.Observable>` 
can be just as easily tested.

In this example, we will additionally test a case where a 
:class:`Disposable <reactivex.Disposable>` is used.

.. code:: python

    def test_my_observable_factory():
        from reactivex.disposable import Disposable, CompositeDisposable
        a = 42
        def factory(observer: Observer, scheduler=None):
            def increment():
                nonlocal a
                a += 1
            sub = Disposable(action=increment)
            return CompositeDisposable(
                sub,
                reactivex.timer(20, scheduler=scheduler).subscribe(observer)
            )

        scheduler = TestScheduler()
        result = scheduler.start(lambda: Observable(factory))
        assert result.messages == [
            on_next(220, 0),
            on_completed(220)
        ]
        assert a == 43  # shows that our Disposable's action was as expected


Testing errors
..............

Going back to the in_sequence_or_throw_ operator, we did not test the error case;
Let's remedy that below.

.. code:: python

    def test_in_sequence_or_throw_error():
        scheduler = TestScheduler()
        source = reactivex.from_marbles('--1-4-3-', timespan=50, scheduler=scheduler)
        result = scheduler.start(lambda: source.pipe(
            in_sequence_or_throw(),
        ), created=1, subscribed=30)

        assert result.messages == [
            on_next(30+100, 1),
            on_error(230, ValueError('Sequence error'))
        ]
        # At times it's better not to test the exact exception, 
        # maybe its message changes with time or other reasons
        # We can test a specific notification's details as follows:
        first_notification, error_notification = result.messages
        assert first_notification.time == 130
        assert error_notification.time == 230
        assert first_notification.value.kind == 'N'  # Notification
        assert error_notification.value.kind == 'E'  # E for errors
        assert first_notification.value.value == 1
        assert type(error_notification.value.exception) == ValueError  # look at .exception for errors


Testing subscriptions, multiple observables, hot observables
............................................................

``scheduler.start`` only allows for a single subscription. 
Some cases like e.g. ``operators.partition`` require more.
The examples below showcase some less commonly needed testing tools.

.. code:: python
    
    def test_multiple():
        scheduler = TestScheduler()
        source = reactivex.from_marbles('-1-4-3-|', timespan=50, scheduler=scheduler)
        odd, even = source.pipe(
            operators.partition(lambda x: x % 2),
        )
        steven = scheduler.create_observer()
        todd = scheduler.create_observer()

        even.subscribe(steven)
        odd.subscribe(todd)

        # Note! Since the subscription is not created within 
        # `scheduler.start` below, the usual `subscribed` delay of t=200
        # is not in effect. The subscriptions therefore occur at t=0
        scheduler.start()

        assert steven.messages == [
            on_next(150, 4),
            on_completed(350)
        ]
        assert todd.messages == [
            on_next(50, 1),
            on_next(250, 3),
            on_completed(350)
        ]


.. code:: python

    from reactivex.testing.subscription import Subscription
    def test_subscriptions():
        scheduler = TestScheduler()
        source = scheduler.create_cold_observable()  # "infinite"
        subs = []
        shared = source.pipe(
            operators.share()
        )
        # Creating our story:
        # first sub is set to occur at t=200; this creates a sub on source
        scheduler.schedule_relative(200, lambda *_: subs.append(shared.subscribe(scheduler=scheduler)))
        # second sub does not create a new sub on source, due to the `share` operator
        scheduler.schedule_relative(300, lambda *_: subs.append(shared.subscribe(scheduler=scheduler)))
        # second sub ends
        scheduler.schedule_relative(500, lambda *_: subs[1].dispose())
        # first sub endsâ€¦ and since there is no sub remaining, the only sub on source should be disposed too
        scheduler.schedule_relative(600, lambda *_: subs[0].dispose())
        # no existing sub on source, therefore this will create a new one
        # we never dispose of it; we will test that infinite sub in the assertions
        scheduler.schedule_relative(900, lambda *_: subs.append(shared.subscribe(scheduler=scheduler)))

        scheduler.start()
        # Check that the submissions on the source are as expected
        assert source.subscriptions == [
            Subscription(200, 600), # only one sub from 200 to 600
            Subscription(900),  # represents an infinite subscription
        ]

.. _test_hot:

.. code:: python

    def test_hot():
        scheduler = TestScheduler()
        # hot starts at 0 but sub starts at 200 so we'll miss 190
        source = scheduler.create_hot_observable(
            on_next(190, 5),
            on_next(300, 42),
            on_completed(500)
        )
        result = scheduler.start(lambda: source.pipe(
            operators.to_marbles(timespan=20, scheduler=scheduler)
        ))

        message = result.messages[0]
        # the subscription starts at 200;
        # since `source` is a hot observable, the notification @190 will not be caught
        # the next notification is at 300 ticks, 
        # which, on our subscription, will show at 100 ticks (300-200 from subscription delay)
        # or 5 "-" each representing 20 ticks (timespan=20 in `to_marbles`).
        # Then the "42" notification is received
        # and then nothing for another 200 ticks, which is equal to 10 "-", before complete
        assert message.value.value == '-----(42)----------|'
