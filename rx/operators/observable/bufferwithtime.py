    timeshift -- [Optional] Interval between creation of consecutive
        buffers (specified as an integer denoting milliseconds), or an
        optional scheduler parameter. If not specified, the time shift
        corresponds to the timespan parameter, resulting in non-overlapping
        adjacent buffers.
    scheduler -- [Optional] Scheduler to run buffer timers on. If not
        specified, the timeout scheduler is used.

    Returns an observable sequence of buffers.
