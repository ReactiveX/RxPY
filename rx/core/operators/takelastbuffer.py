        Example:
            >>> res = take_last(source)

        This operator accumulates a buffer with a length enough to
        store elements count elements. Upon completion of the source
        sequence, this buffer is drained on the result sequence. This
        causes the elements to be delayed.

        Args:
            source: Source observable to take elements from.

        Returns:
            An observable sequence containing a single list with the
            specified number of elements from the end of the source
            sequence.
