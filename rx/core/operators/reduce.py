    """Applies an accumulator function over an observable sequence,
    returning the result of the aggregation as a single element in the
    result sequence. The specified seed value is used as the initial
    accumulator value.

    For aggregation behavior with incremental intermediate results, see
    `scan()`.

    Examples:
        >>> res = reduce(lambda acc, x: acc + x)
        >>> res = reduce(lambda acc, x: acc + x, 0)

    Args:
        accumulator: An accumulator function to be
            invoked on each element.
        seed: Optional initial accumulator value.

    Returns:
        An operator function that takes an observable source and returns
        an observable sequence containing a single element with the
        final accumulator value.
