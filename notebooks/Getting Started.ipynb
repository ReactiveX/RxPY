    "# Getting Started with RxPY\n",
    "\n",
    "[ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io), or Rx for short, is an API for programming with observable event streams. RxPY is a port of ReactiveX to Python. Learning Rx with Python is particularly interesting since Python removes much of the clutter that comes with statically typed languages. RxPY works with both Python 2 and Python 3 but all examples in this tutorial uses [Python 3.4](http://www.python.org)."

It's up the the sort stability of the scheduler to decide which event should go first. For real time data streams this will not be a problem since the events will be separated by actual time. To make sure you get the results you \"expect\", it's always a good idea to add some time between the events when playing with Rx."
